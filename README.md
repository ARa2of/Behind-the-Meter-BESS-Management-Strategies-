This repository contains a tool of three different power management strategies for the domestic residential batteries - October 2020 .

This tool can be used to generate the power dispatch of residential batteries (with any specifications) to minimize the household's electricity bill for any time series data (single day to multiple years) with any temporal resolution. 

The outputs of the RBMT are:
1.	The net household demand. 
2.	Electricity bill with and without the battery.
3.	Battery power dispatch.
4.	Battery state of charge.
5.	Battery degradation. 
6.	Household’s voltage.
7.	Household’s losses. 


Please check the ToolGuide.pdf file for more details and guidance on how to use the code. 

This tool was validated and detailed in a submitted paper titled ‘Domestic Battery Power Management Strategies to Maximize the Profitability and Support the Network’, authored by Ahmed A.Raouf Mohamed, Robert J. Best, Xueqin Liu, and  D. John Morrow. School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen’s University Belfast. 
More details on this paper will be announced soon.
