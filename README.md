This repository contains a code of three different power management strategies for the domestic residential batteries - October 2020 .
More details on this code will be announced soon through a published paper. 
This code can be used to generate the power dispatch of residential batteries (with any specifications) to minimize the household's electricity bill for any time period (single day to multiple years). The output is the net demand and electricity bill with and without the battery, in addition to the battery power dispatch, state of charge and degradation.
The code has been developed by Ahmed A.Raouf Mohamed - EPIC Research Cluster, School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Queen's University in Belfast, UK.  (https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/ahmed-mohamed). This work is part of SPIRE 2 Project (https://www.ulster.ac.uk/spire2/the-project). For any inquiry: amohamed06@qub.ac.uk / Ra2ooof@gmail.com
